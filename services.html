                                    NDIS understands community plays an important role in all aspects of our lives.
                                    Being a part of a community can make us feel as though we belong to something bigger
                                    than ourselves and it gives us the opportunity to connect with people. We understand
                                    often when people are unwell or have limited capacity they may withdraw from the
                                    community and the thought of engaging again can be quite overwhelming. Let your
                                    Support Worker guide and strengthen you to become an active member in the community
                                    again in a way that's meaningful for you.
